            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>My name is Charan Kumar. I am 11 years old and my hobby is coding and writing stories. I also like to play keyboard and play badminton. My father's name is Ramasubramanian and my mother's name is Indhumathy. I study 7th grade in Chellapan Vidya Mandir(CVMIS) in Karaikudi. My sister's name is Kayal and I love her so much. Whenever I feel bored, we play together, watch videos together or do many other activities together. She studies in the same school as mine.<br><br>Till 5th grade, I studied in Singapore and I love Singapore so much. It is the best country i've ever visited. However, I equally like India for many reasons. I was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. All my relatives are in Tamil Nadu . When I used to live in Singapore, for summer/winter vacations, Me and my family always travel to Tamil Nadu to visit our relatives and friends.</p>
